## Get Started

### Requirements
- **A Paystack account**: If you don't already have one, [sign up for a Paystack account](https://dashboard.paystack.com/#/signup). You'll need to do this to get your API keys.
- **API keys**: You can grab these [from your Paystack dashboard](https://dashboard.paystack.com/#/settings/developers)
- **Existing plans**: You'll need to have existing (active) plan objects that you can subscribe your customers to. If you don't already have any plans, you can just create a couple [from your Paystack dashboard](https://dashboard.paystack.com/#/plans?status=active)
